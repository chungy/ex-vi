TODO list for ex

- Some support for UTF-8 combining characters should probably be added.

- Since the POSIX standard developers did not include a method to
    determine whether something is a valid collation symbol or an
    equivalence class, and since there is no access to the basic
    collation sequence, LC_COLLATE locales are completely ignored.

- There may be other unresolved POSIX.2 demands I did not notice yet.
    Please write me if you find one. You can get SUSv2 from The Open
    Group <http://www.UNIX-systems.org/> for $0, it contains nearly the
    same text for ex/vi as POSIX.2 and is a good reference manual.

- SVr4 ex probably has some silent features that this one should have too.

- SUSv3 / POSIX.1-200x ex/vi support.
    I did not yet decide whether this is worth implementing. It requires
    a lot of mostly small changes that make vi more nvi-like in general.
    If SUSv3 has as little success in the Open Source world as its
    predecessors, it might be better to ignore it and stay on the
    officially obsolete SUSv2 / POSIX.2 level.

- The traditional regular expression code in ex_re.c could be updated to
    work with multibyte characters. This would mostly involve to take the
    code from libcommon/regexp.h of the Heirloom Toolchest.

- Translated message catalogues.
